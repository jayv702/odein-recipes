    <h3> The process of making a smoothie.</h3>

    <body>
        <p>The following are the instructions and ingredients to make a smoothie. During my childhood
            I would just add whatever. Though one day things changed and I decided to have 
            instructions in my life. Through this learning process I realized I could replicate
            my smoothie process daily, so I can always enjoy the smoothie liked the most.
            This is my story of my smoothie making process.
